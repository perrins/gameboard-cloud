Adapter Tests - run stand-alone or under CI build

Tests can be run under npm 

cd to the unit test directory within Jenkins checked out repository
install the adapter invoker utility module
Then all other dependencies
Finally execute the test script


    cd Homebase/adapters/UnitTest

## MJP Can we change the name of my_modules to modules or project_modules, they are not mine :)

    npm install my_modules
    npm install

then 
    npm test
    
    
## MJP Its not very clear how you run the tests for just one adapter here, add some samples.    
    
to run the script named "test" or any other of the scripts defined in package.json
    
    npm run-script <scriptName>

The test names are listed in the package.json file in the UnitTest directory and reference each test sequence

eg. npm run-script rvtest

    
For example buildTestAll runs all test .js files gathering the xunit report, in the script we
redirect this to a file in the workspace, and this is then picked up by post build Jenkins reporting.

Note that domain, port and contextRoot for stub server can be 
overridden by an additional

    npm config set AdapterTests:port=10080
    npm config set AdapterTests:domain=localhost
    npm config set AdapterTests:contextRoot=Homebase
    
command
